                <h1>Red Wine</h1>

                <div class="food-details-info">
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. The color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Red wine has been part of social, religious, and cultural events for hundreds of years. Medieval monasteries believed that their monks lived longer partly because of their regular, moderate drinking of wine.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Whether you're a classic merlot drinker, a spicy shiraz lover, or keep things fruity with a cool zinfandel, there's something magical about these burgundy-colored beverages. From the vines to the glass, the wine making process is an art all in itself, and the results it leaves you with are pretty damn wonderful. Rumor even has it that drinking a glass of red wine is the same as getting an hour of exercise... yeah, that's some crazy stuff.</p>
